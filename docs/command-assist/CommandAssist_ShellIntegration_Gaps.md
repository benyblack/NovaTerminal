# Command Assist Shell Integration Gaps

## Implemented In M3
- generic shell integration contract
- App-layer launch-plan selection
- PowerShell bootstrap integration with full structured command capture
  (`OSC 133;A`, `OSC 133;C;<base64>`, `OSC 133;D;<exit>;<duration>`, `OSC 7`)
- Bash provider via `--rcfile` (DEBUG trap preexec, `PROMPT_COMMAND` precmd)
- Zsh provider via `ZDOTDIR` env-override (native `precmd_functions` /
  `preexec_functions` hooks; user prompt ownership preserved)
- Fish provider via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env-override (native `fish_preexec` /
  `fish_postexec` / `fish_prompt` event hooks)
- environment-variable override plumbing through `ShellIntegrationLaunchPlan`,
  `RustPtySession`, and the `pty_spawn_with_envs` Rust FFI (used by Zsh and Fish)
- structured exit-code and duration enrichment for command history
- heuristic fallback when structured integration is unavailable or not yet confirmed

## Current Limitations
- shell integration is local-only; SSH launch plans skip provider injection
  because env-var overrides do not propagate across SSH
- providers bail out (`IsIntegrated: false`) when the user forces an
  incompatible startup mode (PowerShell `-File`; bash `-c`/`--rcfile`/`--init-file`;
  zsh `-c`/`--no-rcs`/`-f`; fish `-c`/`--no-config`/`-N`); those sessions fall
  back to heuristic capture
- `BashBootstrapBuilder` uses a one-shot guard around the DEBUG trap to filter
  out internal hook calls, but commands run inside `PROMPT_COMMAND` itself can
  still race the guard in pathological user configurations
- prompt preservation is best-effort and depends on each shell's native prompt
  ownership conventions

## Deferred Follow-Up Areas
- richer shell-specific prompt contracts beyond the current wrapper approach
- SSH-side bootstrap injection (would require remote shell-kind detection and
  remote env-var control)
- additional setup UX in settings or profile surfaces

## Non-Goals Of M3
- AI assistance
- help/fix/documentation surfaces from later milestones
- terminal-grid inline suggestion rendering
- VT/render-core refactors
