### 2.2 Advanced Tab Actions
- **Rename:** Use `Tab: Rename Current` to set a custom title.
- **Pin & Protect:** Use `Tab: Toggle Pin` to pin a tab and `Tab: Toggle Protect` to protect it from accidental closure.

### 2.3 Workspaces & Templates
Workspaces save your exact window state, including tabs, pane splits, and zooming.
- **Save/Load:** `Workspace: Save Current` and `Workspace: Load...`
- **Templates:** Save reusable layouts via `Workspace Template: Save Current` and apply them with `Workspace Template: Apply...`.
- **Profile Rules:** Automatically apply a template whenever a specific profile launches (`Tab Rule: Set Template for Current Profile...`).

### 2.4 Workspace Bundles (Portable Sessions)
Bundles allow exporting and importing tabs and pane layouts as portable `.novaws.json` files.
- **Exporting:** `Workspace: Export Bundle...` or `Workspace: Export Current Session Bundle...`
- **Import/Open:** `Workspace: Import Bundle...` or `Workspace: Open Bundle...`
*(Note: Enterprise policies may restrict bundle sharing in managed environments).*

## 3. Panes and Layouts
Panes allow you to split a single tab into multiple terminal windows.

### 3.1 Splitting and Navigation
- **Split Vertical:** `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Places a new pane side-by-side).
- **Split Horizontal:** `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Places a new pane below).
- **Close Pane:** `Ctrl+Shift+W` (Closes only the active pane, leaving others open).
- **Navigation:** Use `Alt+Left`, `Alt+Right`, `Alt+Up`, `Alt+Down` to move focus between panes.
- **Equalize:** `Ctrl+Shift+G` resets pane sizes to be equal.

### 3.2 Advanced Pane Features
- **Zoom Pane:** `Ctrl+Shift+Z` toggles zooming of the active pane to fill the entire tab temporarily.
- **Broadcast Input:** `Ctrl+Shift+B` toggles sending keystrokes to *all* panes in the current tab simultaneously.
- **Find/Search:** `Ctrl+Shift+F` opens the search overlay for the active pane.

## 4. Remote Connections (SSH & SFTP)
NovaTerminal supports high-performance SSH sessions integrated directly into the terminal, with built-in remote file management.

### 4.1 SSH Profiles and Connection Manager
- Easily maintain local and SSH profiles in your Settings.
- **Security:** Credentials use secure platform vault backends. No unexpected password injections triggered by terminal output are allowed for your safety. Fast reconnects and config caching simplify remote work.

### 4.2 Built-in SFTP Transfers
Access the following commands via the palette to transfer files and folders between your local machine and the SSH host:
- `SFTP: Upload File...` / `SFTP: Upload Folder...`
- `SFTP: Download File...` / `SFTP: Download Folder...`
- `SFTP: Show Transfers`: Toggles the Transfer Center overlay to monitor ongoing transfers.

*(Note: SFTP commands only function when the active pane is an SSH session).*
